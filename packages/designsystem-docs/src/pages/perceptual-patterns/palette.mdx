# Palette
<MDXCustom.Preamble>
You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! Look at that text! Would anyone use that?
</MDXCustom.Preamble>

## Something clever here

It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.

That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok?
