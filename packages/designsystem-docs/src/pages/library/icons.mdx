# Icons

<MDXCustom.Preamble>
  Adding icons to a button or an input field can extend the context and meaning to the user. This set of icons created
  specifically for Helsenorge is delightful and encompass our vision of brining the user closer to manage their own
  patient potential.

## Usage

I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable.
