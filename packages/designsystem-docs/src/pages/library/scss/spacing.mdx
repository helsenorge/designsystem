# Spacing

<MDXCustom.Preamble>
  A spacing system is provided through components and  sass functions.
  <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/spacing/" target="_blank">Bootstrap's grid system also provides its system</a>
</MDXCustom.Preamble>

## How to use


- You can add spacing by using the [Spacer component](/library/components/spacer)
- You can import getSpacer function from /scss/_spacers.scss and use it with t-shirt sizes.
F.ex: getSpacer(m)// tilsvarer key 5 = 0.75rem = 12px
- You can import $spacer and $spacers from /scss/_spacers.scss and use them with map-get and its key (number).
F.ex: map-get($spacers, 5); // tilsvarer 0.75rem = 12px


## Spacer scale:

- 1 – 3xs = 2px / 0.125rem
- 2 – 2xs = 	4 px / 0,25 rem
- 3 – xs = 	8 px / 0,5 rem
- 4 – s = 	16 px / 1 rem
- 5 – m = 	24 px / 1,5 rem
- 6 – l = 	32 px / 2 rem
- 7 – xl = 	48 px / 3 rem
- 8 – 2xl = 	64 px / 4 rem
- 9 – 3xl = 	80 px / 5 rem
- 10 – 4xl = 	112 px / 7 rem
- 11 – 5xl =	128 px / 8 rem
