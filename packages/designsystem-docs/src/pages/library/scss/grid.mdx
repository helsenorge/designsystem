# Grid and breakpoints

<MDXCustom.Preamble>
  Our library comes with global styling which also includes usage of a forked Bootstrap's grid system. Some of our
  internal services and projects use this grid system as the basis for positioning and alignment.

```scss 

$grid-gutter-width: map-get($spacers, 5); // tilsvarer 0.75rem = 12px
