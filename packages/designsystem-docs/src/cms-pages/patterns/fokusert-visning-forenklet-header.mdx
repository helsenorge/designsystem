* **Problem**: Problems are related to the usage of the system and are relevant to the user or any other stakeholder that is interested in usability.
* **Use when**: a situation (in terms of the tasks, the users and the context of use) giving rise to a usability problem. This section extends the plain problem-solutions dichotomy by describing situations in which the problems occur.
* **Principle**: a pattern is usually based on one or more ergonomic principles such as user guidance, or consistency, or error management.
* **Solution**: a proven solution to the problem. A solution describes only the core of the problem, and the designer has the freedom to implement it in many ways. Other patterns may be needed to solve sub problems.
* **Why**: How and why the pattern actually works, including an analysis of how it may affect certain attributes of usability. The rationale (why) should provide a reasonable argument for the specified impact on usability when the pattern is applied. The why should describe which usability aspects should have been improved or which other aspects might suffer.
* **Examples**: Each example shows how the pattern has been successfully applied in a real life system. This is often accompanied by a screenshot and a short description.
* **Implementation**: Some patterns provide implementation details.
